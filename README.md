Goal: my goal for this app is to simulate the neurological condition known as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/synesthesia#:~:text=Synesthesia%20is%20a%20neurological%20condition,activated%20at%20the%20same%20time.">synesthesia</a>. This is will be a single page React application in which the web browser can identify colors on a live video feed, and output an audible sound correlating to the color value.

Current status: front-end able to recognize the color red. 
next steps: build algorithm to handle multiple color detections


to run:
1) go to file directory
