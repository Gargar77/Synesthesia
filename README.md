# Synesthesia

A simulation app that can capture and analyze a live video, 
which is then converted into an audible sound, simulating the neurological condition known as Synesthesia. 

*09/24/10 The app is currently in the early stages of development. I have researched how to change the pixel data of a live webcam feed. 
With this knowledge, my next step will be to understand how I can track certain colors using rgb, 
which can then be converted in to a certain sound frequency.
